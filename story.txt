I'm trapped. I've been trapped in this pit for god who knows how long.
Everysingle day is the same, just a blur of faces, people come from miles
around to just to see me. I miss the jungle though, the feeling of being
free. That's why I've decided I'm going to escape.

Long ago I decided There is no way I'm climbing out of this pit.The top is 
sealed with impenetrable steel bars and guards are close by most hours of the day.
For months I've been working every second it's too dark for the guards to see me.
I've digging with nothing but sticks and rocks for 63 days now.
