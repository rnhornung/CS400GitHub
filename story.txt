I'm trapped. I've been trapped in this pit for god who knows how long.
Everysingle day is the same, just a blur of faces, people come from miles
around to just to see me. I miss the jungle though, the feeling of being
free. That's why I've decided I'm going to escape.

Long ago I decided There is no way I'm climbing out of this pit.The top is 
sealed with impenetrable steel bars and guards are close by most hours of the day.
For months I've been working every second it's too dark for the guards to see me.
I've digging with nothing but sticks and rocks for 63 days now.

Mary:
But tomorrow is the day. I tended to my bloody paws, slowly but surely formulating
the final part of my plan. Morning came and so I hid deep in my tunnel, waiting for
the man to come and look for me. The footsteps were coming closer and closer. Finally 
my owner was within reach. I pounced, landing square on his chest and ripping his 
throat out. His lifeless body looked delicious but I must run, for at last I am free.
